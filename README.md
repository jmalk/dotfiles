# dotfiles

A backup of configuration files. Can be cloned into a directory, e.g. dotfiles/ then symlinked to from the home directory, or put in place manually.

## Prerequisites

To load plugins specified in `init.vim` and `vimrc` you will need [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## Useful Tip

To make a symlink on a Mac run `ln -s /path/to/original/ /path/to/link`
